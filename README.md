# Linear-Regression-
 A machine learning project to show that a particular data set shows linear regression
 ## note:
1) download the USAhousing.csv file prior.
2) Coding should be done in jupyter notebook line by line.
### Points to Ponder
#### Steps In Machine Learning:
This project processes through the steps of machine learning.
1) Data Collection
2) Cleaning the data 
3) Data Analysis
4) Data Visualisation
5) Algorithm Selection
6) Algorithm Training
7) Algorithm Testing
8) Output

#### Supervised Data:
 Data is categorised Perfectly. Its is usually a set of labelled data
 
#### Unsupervised Data:
Its a set of unlabelled data. It is data driven.

### CLASSICAL MACHINE LEARNING
###### Supervised:
1) Classification
2) Regression
###### Unsupervised
1) Dimension Reduction(generalisation)
2) Clustering
3) Association


Reason behind selecting the USA housing Data set is because of the accuracy of values.

Comments are added in the code part which illustrates the need of every line.
